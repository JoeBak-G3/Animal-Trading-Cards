			<p>The cowbird is a bird which keeps its eggs among the eggs of other birds. When incidentally discovered by the other host bird and it removes these eggs or destroys it, the cowbird comes at times they are not present and destroys all its eggs. This cowbird palaver is a headache for most birds but not the yellow warbler which has unique wisdom to handle this issue.</p>
